# Flutter Apps Collection ðŸš€

This repository contains 10 Flutter apps I built during Summer 2025 to improve my Flutter skills.  
These apps were originally created by following open-source learning resources and tutorials (MIT License).  
I have customized and enhanced them to practice UI/UX, state management, Firebase, and API integration.
